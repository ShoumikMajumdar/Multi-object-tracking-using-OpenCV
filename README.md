# Multi-object-tracking-using-OpenCV

The goal of this project is to track multiple object using recursive bayesial filtering and data association methods. In this case, I use Kalman Filter for position predictions
and the Hungarian algorithm for data association.

The script for tracking bats is bats.py
The script for tracking cell divisions is cells.py

The data can be found in the BatImages and CellImages folders
